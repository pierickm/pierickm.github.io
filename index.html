High-quality smart watches, made to track sports and health are a great tool to <strong>check your fitness progress while working out</strong> and being active and it can remind you of your goals.

                    <p>Like some smart watches, performance trackers are <strong>a great tool to track your sporting progress</strong>. However, these were first marketed towards professional athletes and are now made more affordable to amateur athletes. Unlike smart watches, they usually do not have a display. Some of them can be connected to your phone via an app where you can check your data live. Others still have to be connected to a laptop or pc to see the data. These performance trackers come in various forms, they can be a small chip that can be clipped on a shoe or a device that can be put in a pocket. <a href="https://eu.shop.statsports.com/"><em>Buy a performance tracker</em></a></p>

                    <header>Virtual reality sports</header>
                    <p>VR opens up a completely new way of staying fit. Where someone might lack motivation and self-discipline for conventional solo sports like running, swimming or going to the gym. With VR sport, a whole new option emerges. You can experience a <strong>gamified version of keeping fit</strong> in the comfort of your own home. No need to drive to the gym, run in the rain or drive to a swimming pool. No one else around staring at you, unless of course you choose to sport with others virtually. <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/?locale=nl_NL"><em>Buy VR gear here</em></a></p>
