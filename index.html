                <p>Like some smart watches, performance trackers are a great tool to track your sporting progress. However, these were first marketed towards professional athletes and are now made more affordable to amateur athletes. Unlike smart watches, they usually do not have a display. Some of them can be connected to your phone via an app where you can check your data live. Others still have to be connected to a laptop or pc to see the data. These performance trackers come in various forms, they can be a small chip that can be clipped on a shoe or a device that can be put in a pocket. <a href="https://eu.shop.statsports.com/">Buy a performance tracker</a></p>
